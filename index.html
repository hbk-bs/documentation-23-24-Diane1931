        <h3>Hello visitors;</h3>
        
        <p><b>My name is Mira, welcome to my page. I study at the HBK and am taking part in a course called Digitale Grundlagen, 
            in which, as the name itself implies, we learn the digital basics in graphic design. We've worked with Javascript; a scripting language,
             in order to create projects based off of and consisting of code.</b>
		<h5>What did I learn?</h5>

          

       
        <h6><em>Insight</em></h6>
		<h6>1. I became familiar with Javascript, giving me an insight into how programs and sites i've always used were created and run, helping me appreciate the work and logic behind it. </h6>
      
        <h6><em>Appreciation</em></h6>
        <h6>2. I discovered the concept of generative design, which not only helped broaden my horizon but helped me understand that art goes beyond the analog, an aspect that is often forgotten. </h6>
		
        <h6><em>Functionality</em></h6>
        <h6>3. I was introduced to Arduino hardware and developed an understanding as to how they function and differ from each other.  </h6>
        
        <h6><em>Logic</em></h6>
        <h6>4. I had to use a logical approach when coding and pay attention to specific rules and givens in order for my project to work, instead of doing whatever and hoping it looks good. I still worked with the principle of coincidence but had to concider speficic things and tick specific boxes beforehand in order to get my code to work.   </h6>
		
        <h6><em>Patience</em></h6>
        <h6>5. Most importantly, I learned that patience and concentration is a very big part of the field and that there's a lot of trial and error involved. Nothing works immediately. It can be a simple mistake that's stopping the entire project from working; the only option then being to read through the code over and over again and changing details till the whole thing works. </h6>
        
        <h6><em>Structure</em></h6>
        <h6>6. I've learned to work systematically and start from scratch and develop a structure on which I base my code, a system which differs
            from that of my standard artistic experience.<h6>


        <h3>These are some of my projects:</h3>
     

        <h5>PROJECT 1: Small Particles;</h5>

       
        <img src="assets/images/Circle 2.png" alt="This is an image.">
        <h6>The goal of this project, was to create a pattern made out of elements that differ from eachother in different ways; for example in color or in shape. The elements that make up the pattern should still have something in common and not differ from eachother completely.  </h6>
        <h6>The chosen particle ended up being a stop-sign like form, since it consists of a rectangle and a circle. I added multiple particles in different sizes, and set the maximum and minimum size they could be.
            <h6>I had specific plan in mind: The size, color and placement of the particles would be chosen randomly. The hue would range from white to black. These factors would change with each refreshing of the page. <h6>


		<img src="assets/images/circle1.png" alt="This is an image.">


        <h6>I programmed some of the stop signs to gradually increase in size, as seen in the image above. <h6>
            <h3>Further examples:</h3>

        <img src="assets/images/Circle 5.png" alt="This is an image.">
      
        
        <h5>PROJECT 2: Algorithmus;</h5>

        <img src="assets/images/Loop 1.jpg" alt="This is an image.">
      
        <h6>The goal of this project, was to write a instruction and have multiple subjects follow it separately. I ended up changing a few details after having three subjects test out my instruction: I made it more specific and took out and changed formulations which were confusing. An example for that being a part in the instruction where the subject is told to turn the page around, I found it to be unneccessary and many found it to be confusing, since there was no specification regarding how much the page must be turned. </h6>
    
        <h6>I made sure to not make it too specific and to give the subject more room to interprete, hoping for new interpretations. I had a vague image in mind of what i would expect the final product to look like, but didn't to end up looking a set way. <h6>

        <h6>What i noticed when watching some of the subjects go through the instruction, was the nervousness that came with it. The formal formulation intimidated many, giving them the impression that there's a right and a wrong, which I found very interesting.  <h6>
    
    
            <h6>The way the different subjects approached the task was also quite telling; some started right away and hoped for the best or read the instruction at the same time. Others read through the instruction multiple times and tried to picture the end-result before starting. <h6>
    
                <h6>The task made me think about the influence personality has on a task; each subject was giving the same task and each result had a personal touch to it. I chose people who I know to a certain extent, and was entertained at how much the result represented the task-taker. It could be speculation and the task was a little bit vague, but i still believe that the personality of the person shines through, when regarding specific factors: such as the cleanliness of the lines, the size of the image, the speed at which they solve the task, the amount of thought 
                    and planning put into it and many more factors.   <h6>
       

    
        <h5>PROJECT 3: Sleeping Uncle;</h5>

        <h6>This was a class project, we agreed on an interactive role-play project, 
            where the player takes on the role of a hungry child, staying over at his monster uncle's,
             who's main goal is to make a midnight sandwich without waking up his sleeping uncle. <h6>


            <h6>We split ourselves into groups in order to specialize and have a better overview of the workload and group idea.
                I was part of the Design Team. Our speciality being the visual aspect of our product.
                Ranging from  character, set, poster to logo design.  <h6></h6>

                <h6>We started off by discussing our ideas with the other groups, to make sure
                    there was a common ground and then went on to design three different monsters. 
                    We ran the design by the other groups, who voted on their favorite. 
                    The next step was to agree on an overall color-scheme and theme. We prepared a moodboard, which
                    included the three character designs, colorscheme examples and style and outline examples. 
                    We agreed on choosing a simple style, in order to make the possibility of animating the uncle less of a struggle, 
                    as pictured below.
      

    <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 2cm;">
        <img src="assets/images/Monster Moodboard.png" alt="This is an image." style="width: 500px; height: auto; margin-left: -3cm;">
    </div>
    


    <h6>We agreed on a design and had the original creator come up with multiple new sketches 
        of the uncle in different moods and acts. We then split up the work and traced those 
        sketches, to avoid all the work falling onto the creator. We used the color palette and outline size we
        had agreed on, in order to maintain consistency.


<h5>The end-result: </h5>

       <h6>We ended up using those exact designs for posters and flyers:<h6>

            <img src="assets/images/Poster.jpg" alt="This is an image."style="width: 500px; height: auto;margin-left: -3cm;">
           </div>
          
           <h6> We chose a comic-like font and decided to give it a 
            monster-flare by adding the devil-like horns and the same magenta used for the horns ,to tie it to our topic and main subject. </h6>

           <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1cm;">
            <img src="assets/images/Flyer.jpg" alt="This is an image."style="width: 500px; height: auto;margin-left: -3cm;">
           </div>

        


   
       <h5>Animations: </h5>

       <h6> We also animated the uncle in two stages of sleep: </h6>

       <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1cm;">
        <img src="assets/images/animated png 1.png" alt="This is an image."style="width: 600px; height: auto;margin-left: -3cm;">
       </div>

       <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1cm;">
        <img src="assets/images/Kurz_Vorm_Aufwecken.png" alt="This is an image."style="width: 600px; height: auto;margin-left: -3cm;">
       </div>


       <h6> The socalled 'Jumpscare', which appears when the uncle is woken (LOSS):</h6>

      <h6>The project was quite fun and brought us closer together in a way,
        whilst requiring us to make comprimises and find a common ground. Most 
        importantly, it also humbled us to a certain extent; helping us
        realize that it's one thing to have an idea but what's with 
        pulling through with it? We had to be honest to ourselves and
        think realistically, by checking our resources and seeing 
        what we are capable of in the specific time-frame given to us.
